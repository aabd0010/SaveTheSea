# SAVE THE OCEAN

## What it does

Our game shows the scenario of a polluted sea. The underwater is dirty, filled with pollutants like plastic waste, dirt and much more. Due to this, sea life is depleting. 
We intend to make awareness that a simple step of not throwing such waste in the water can **save the sea**.
In our game, when you click on the ‘save the sea’ button, it clears the pollutants and the sea life is revived. This small step can re-clean the waters.
To give more information to the user, we have set a video by the UN on the matter. 

## How we built it
Our team used Google Docs to discuss and plan out the project. We decided to use Unity to build the AR scene and EchoAR to set the models. We used C# make a script to tweak the functionality and placement of models on the scene whilst keeping communicating together through Discord.
